# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.10.0] - 2025-08-16

### Added

- Core: Added bulk\_export() function to dowload bulk record data

### Changed

- Core: Switched to a requests.session object to enable persistent connection recycling.
- Core: Provide options to disable pagination and prevent api result's JSON parsing (in association with bulk\_export).

### Fixed

- Core: do not prepend the base\_url to the uri of an api\_call if a protocol is already included (i.e. uri is already fully-formed).

## [0.9.1] - 2025-06-13

### Changed

#### `.github/workflows/release.yml`

- Introduced a new step `Determine Effective Version` to compute a more accurate version number depending on whether Python files were changed:
  - If Python files changed, uses `gitversion`'s semantic version (`semVer`).
  - If no Python files changed, forces a patch bump based on the previous tag.
- The `effective_version` output is now used consistently across:
  - The `Update CHANGELOG.md` step.
  - The commit message for updating `pyproject.toml`.
  - The Git tag and GitHub Release.
  - The `pyproject.toml` version field.
- Adjusted the condition for the `Build release distributions` step to run only if Python files changed.
- Simplified and cleaned up various comments in the workflow for better readability and maintainability.

## [0.9.0] - 2025-06-13

### Changed

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**
  - Modified the version bump logic in `.github/workflows/release.yml` to apply major/minor/patch logic only if Python files have changed. If no Python files changed, the workflow now forces a patch bump to prevent unintended major or minor releases.

## [0.8.0] - 2025-06-13

### Added

- Added a step to detect if any Python files were changed (`check-python-changes`) in the release workflow.

- The `release` and `publish to PyPI` steps now only run if Python files were changed.

- The workflow now supports Python 3.12 and Python 3.13 in addition to 3.9â€“3.11.

- In the Dev Container:
  - Added GitHub Actions support extension.
  - Added VSCode Icons extension.
  - Added Markdown All in One extension.
  - Added Markdown Checkbox extension.
  - Added Markdown Preview GitHub Styles extension.

- In the VSCode workspace recommendations:
  - Added GitHub Actions extension to `.vscode/extensions.json`.

### Changed

- Improved release workflow logic to skip release and publish steps if no Python files were changed.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-06-13

### Added

#### `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

- Introduced a new Visual Studio Code **development container** configuration to streamline the development environment.
  - Uses the base Ubuntu image from Microsoft's devcontainers.
  - Adds common development utilities via `common-utils` feature.
  - Installs VS Code extensions:
    - `elagil.pre-commit-helper`
    - `ms-python.python`
  - Runs `.devcontainer/setup.sh` post container creation for environment setup.

#### `.devcontainer/setup.sh`

- Added a setup script for the development container:
  - Installs **Poetry** package manager.
  - Installs all project dependencies, including development dependencies.
  - Activates the Poetry virtual environment and opens a shell.
  - Installs **pre-commit hooks** for code quality enforcement.

### Changed

#### `Contributing.md`

- Updated instructions for activating the Poetry virtual environment:
  - Changed from `poetry shell` to `eval $(poetry env activate)` for improved shell compatibility and automation.

#### `README.md`

- Added badges to the top of the README for enhanced project visibility:
  - **PyPI version** badge.
  - **PyPI downloads** badge.
  - **GPL v3 License** badge.

#### `pyproject.toml`

- Added new dependency:
  - `shell` package (`^1.0.1`) for enhanced shell scripting and command execution capabilities within the project.
